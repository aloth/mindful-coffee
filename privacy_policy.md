# Privacy Policy for Mindful Coffee

**Effective Date:** May 27, 2025

At Mindful Coffee ("we," "us," or "our"), operated by Alexander Loth, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data is handled responsibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application, Mindful Coffee ("App"). We comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA), the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other relevant privacy laws.

## 1. Information We Collect

We are committed to minimizing data collection. The information we handle can be categorized as follows:

### 1.1. Data You Provide and Store Locally
All data you enter directly into the App related to your caffeine consumption, such as logs, notes, sleep data (if manually entered or imported and modified), and personal settings (e.g., metabolism preferences, thresholds), is **stored locally on your device using SwiftData**. We do not transmit this personal consumption data to our servers, and we do not have access to it.

### 1.2. Apple Health Integration (Optional)
With your explicit permission, the App may integrate with Apple Health (HealthKit) to:
-   **Read** sleep analysis data for deeper correlations and insights.
-   **Write** caffeine consumption and drink volume (as water) automatically to Apple Health.
-   **Import** previously logged third-party caffeine data from Apple Health (optional).

This integration is entirely optional. Any data accessed from or written to Apple Health is processed according to Apple's guidelines and your permissions. This data, once in the App, is also stored locally on your device.

### 1.3. Information Related to In-App Purchases (Pro Features)
To offer and manage premium "Pro Features" via in-app purchases (subscriptions or a one-time purchase), we use **RevenueCat** as a third-party service provider.
-   **What RevenueCat Handles:** RevenueCat helps us manage your subscription status, validate purchases, and ensure you have access to the Pro Features you've paid for.
-   **Information Processed by RevenueCat:** When you make an in-app purchase, Apple processes your payment directly. We do not see or store your payment card details. RevenueCat receives purchase information from Apple, such as your purchase history for our App, subscription status, and an anonymous subscriber identifier generated by RevenueCat or Apple. This allows RevenueCat to verify your entitlement to Pro Features.
-   **Anonymity:** Mindful Coffee does not send personal consumption data (like your caffeine logs) to RevenueCat. RevenueCat's system is designed to work with anonymous or pseudonymous identifiers.
-   For more information on how RevenueCat handles data, please see **RevenueCat's Privacy Policy:** [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

### 1.4. Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Anonymized Data (Future Possibility)
In the future, we might collect non-personal, aggregated, or anonymized data for analytical purposes (e.g., app usage statistics, crash reports if you opt-in via iOS settings) to improve the App. Any such collection would be done in a way that does not personally identify you. This policy will be updated if such practices are implemented. Currently, all analysis and machine learning routines run entirely locally on your device.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

-   **To Provide App Functionality:** Your locally stored data is used solely to deliver, maintain, and improve the functionality of Mindful Coffee. This includes tracking your caffeine intake, analyzing trends, providing personalized insights, and enabling Pro Features.
-   **To Manage Pro Features:** Information processed by RevenueCat (as described in section 1.3) is used to verify and manage your access to Pro Features.
-   **To Improve the App:** As mentioned in 1.4, any future collection of non-personal, anonymized, or aggregated data would be used to understand usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, and enhance app performance and stability.

## 3. Sharing of Your Information

We are committed to your privacy.
-   **No Sale of Personal Data:** We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.
-   **Local Data:** Your personal consumption data (caffeine logs, etc.) remains on your device and is not shared by us with any third parties for their own use.
-   **Service Providers:** We use third-party service providers for specific functionalities.
    *   **RevenueCat:** As detailed above, RevenueCat is used for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions. They process data according to their privacy policy.
    *   **Apple:** Apple handles the In-App Purchase payment process and HealthKit integration according to their terms and privacy policies.
-   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App, or protect against legal liability.

## 4. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect your locally stored data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. All calculations, analysis, and any machine learning routines run entirely locally on your device.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Data managed by third-party services like Apple (for payments and HealthKit) and RevenueCat (for subscription management) is subject to their respective security practices.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under the age of 16 (or a higher age threshold if stipulated by local law, e.g., in the EU). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under the relevant age, please contact us.

## 6. Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. Since Mindful Coffee primarily stores your data locally on your device, many of these rights can be exercised directly by you:
-   **Access, Correction, Deletion:** You can access, modify, and delete your consumption data directly within the App (e.g., by deleting entries or the app itself, which would remove locally stored data).
-   **Data Portability:** The App allows you to export your complete consumption history via CSV files (a Pro Feature), enabling data portability.
-   **HealthKit Data:** You can manage permissions for HealthKit data sharing through your device's Settings app.
-   **Subscription Data (via RevenueCat/Apple):** To manage your subscriptions or request information about data held by Apple or RevenueCat related to your purchases, you would typically interact with Apple's App Store account settings or contact Apple/RevenueCat support directly.

For residents of specific regions:
-   **EU/EEA/UK Residents (GDPR/UK GDPR):** You have rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object to processing.
-   **California Residents (CCPA/CPRA):** You have rights including the right to know what personal information is collected, used, and disclosed, the right to delete personal information, the right to opt-out of the sale/sharing of personal information (we do not sell/share your personal consumption data in a way that would trigger this opt-out for such data), the right to correct inaccurate personal information, and the right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.

To exercise any rights concerning data that might be held by us (e.g., support correspondence), or if you have questions about your rights, please contact us using the details below.

## 7. Data Retention
Your personal consumption data is stored locally on your device and remains there until you delete it or uninstall the App. Data related to your subscriptions managed by RevenueCat is retained according to their policies and Apple's policies.

## 8. International Data Transfers
Your locally stored data resides on your device. If you interact with our support or if we use service providers (like RevenueCat) that operate internationally, your information might be processed in countries other than your own. We and our service providers take steps to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, the App's functionality, or applicable laws. The updated policy will be posted in the App and/or on our website, and the "Effective Date" at bikershades top will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
