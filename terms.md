Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Mindful Coffee mobile application (the "App" or "Service") operated by Alexander Loth ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.

By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

## 2. Description of Service
Mindful Coffee is a mobile application designed to help users track their caffeine intake, understand its potential impact on their energy levels and sleep, and make informed choices. The App offers both free and premium features. Premium features ("Pro Features") may be available through in-app purchases, including subscriptions or a one-time purchase, managed via Apple's In-App Purchase system and facilitated by **RevenueCat**.

## 3. Use of the App
Mindful Coffee is intended for personal, non-commercial use to track and understand caffeine consumption. You agree to use the App responsibly and not to:
-   Use the App for any unlawful or prohibited purpose.
-   Attempt to decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the App, except as permitted by applicable law.
-   Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based upon the App.
-   Use the App in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the App or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the App.
-   Exploit the App for any commercial purposes without our express prior written consent.
-   Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we may employ.

## 4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions (Pro Features)
The App may offer Pro Features through auto-renewing subscriptions or a one-time lifetime purchase.
-   **Payment:** Payments will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.
-   **Free Trials:** Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

-   **Changes to Price and Subscription Plans:** We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our Service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.

## 5. Data and Privacy

-   We do not guarantee the uninterrupted availability, accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of calculations, predictions, or information provided by the App. Information may not be suitable for all individuals due to personal health factors, sensitivities, or other conditions.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Alexander Loth, its affiliates, directors, employees, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, profits, goodwill, or other intangible losses) arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the App or any content or services therein, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.

Our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the use of or any inability to use any portion of the Service or otherwise arising out of these Terms, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited to the amount you have paid us for access to or use of the Service in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (USD 100.00), if you have not had any payment obligations to us, as applicable.

The App and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Alexander Loth and its licensors. The App is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both Germany and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.

## 9. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect (e.g., via an in-app notification or by updating the "Last updated" date). What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.
