# Mindful Coffee: Caffeine Log & Cortisol Rhythm

**Track your caffeine, visualize your cortisol rhythm, and optimize your energy & sleep.**

Mindful Coffee is a smart iOS app designed to help you monitor your daily caffeine intake and discover its deep connection to your body's natural energy curve. Log your coffee, tea, and other caffeinated drinks to gain valuable insights into your **cortisol rhythm**, sleep patterns, and overall well-being. Empower yourself to make smarter choices for more restful nights and productive, focused days.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Effortless & Detailed Logging:** Quickly record your caffeine consumption with a user-friendly interface. After logging, you're brought back to the "Today" screen for an immediate overview. Customize your beverage list with:
    * **Smart Sorting Options:** Sort your drink list by "Last Used" or "Most Used" for even faster logging.
* **NEW! Cortisol Rhythm Modeling:** See your body's natural energy curve (the Cortisol Awakening Response or CAR) to optimize your caffeine timing for better focus and well-being. Understand how each drink impacts this vital rhythm.
